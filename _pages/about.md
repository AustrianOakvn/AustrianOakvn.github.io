Hi there, Welcome to Huy Hoang Bui page. I'm currently a Master student at [Advanced Intelligent System Lab](http://www.aislab.org/index.php/en/) at GSISE, Ritsumeikan University, supervised by [Prof. Joo-ho Lee](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=71HqkKkAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Prof. Tran Dinh Tuan](https://sites.google.com/view/tuantd). My interests lies at the intersection of deep learning and traditional 3D computer vision. My research includes Visual Localization, SLAM, Odometry, and Robotics.

I graduated with Engineering degree from School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Hanoi University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Pham Doan Tinh](). During undergrad, my research interests were mainly indoor localization using Wifi RSSI, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and Sensor Fusion techniques.

I'm also looking for a short intership/PhD position related to my research after Master graduation. If you are interested, feel free to contact me.
